# ExData_Plotting1
Plotting Assignment 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis.

This repository was forked from rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1. I have kept his original files but changed his "README.md" into "FORKED_README.md" in order to add my own README file.

This repository contains:

- A folder named "figures" from the original rdpeng repository, with his original figures.
- A "FORKED_README.md" file (explained above).
- An R script named "picture_code.R", not necesary for the assignment, which contains the common code to read the required lines of the file "household_power_consumption.txt".
- Four R scripts named plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R that **read** the partial data set and **generates** the four required figures.
- The four png figures, plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png, resulting from the execution of the corresponding four named plotN.R scripts.
